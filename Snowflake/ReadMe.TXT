Inspired by the following Reddit post by Billy_o_tea:

Converted to quickfort template by OscarBrownbread on 18.10.2022 using Picturefort.
128 bedrooms with two tiles of space in a 40 by 40 area.
Modifications from the original Reddit post: 
1. Used cabinets instead of chests
2. Door, cabinet, bed in that order

By default, the starting point is the top left tile og  the top left stairwell. Note that the stairwells are not aligned by design.

Issues: I noticed a bit of cancellation spam, e.g. cannot reach site, suspends construction of cabinet, innaccessible site. It was busy as I placed furniture while still digging out. When there is stone in the rooms, there is not much room to move the stone to the side. I suggest dumping or moving the stone from the rooms.
