Inspired by the following Reddit post by Billy_o_tea:

Converted to quickfort template by OscarBrownbread on 18.10.2022 using Picturefort.
128 bedrooms with two tiles of space in a 40 by 40 area.
Modifications from the original Reddit post: 
1. Used cabinets instead of chests
2. Door, cabinet, bed in that order

By default, the starting point is the top right tile of the top right stairwell. Note that the stairwells are not aligned by design, so take care when repeating the template over z levels.
