Compact, tileable design that does away with corridors. 168 bedrooms with a central staircase. Furnished with bed, 2 cabinets, and a container. Fits in a 40 by 40 area.

Dwarfs do not get bad thoughs from others pathing through their rooms. I do not know how this design affects FPS, but I have not witnessed any problems.
